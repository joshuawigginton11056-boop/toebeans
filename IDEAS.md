# Ideas

Parked ideas and observations — not commitments. Per CLAUDE.md, tangents
land here instead of in code.

- **Finish line / run completion** (noticed 2026-07-20, during the 9-lives
  session): the slope currently never ends — you ski past the last chasm
  forever. A finish line is needed before XP can exist, because "a
  forfeited run pays half of what a *completed* run pays" (DESIGN.md)
  requires "completed" to be a real thing. Probably part of the fun-check
  session or the first XP session.
- **The nature pack has ~126 more models we didn't use** (noticed
  2026-07-21, first slope-assets session): the Quaternius Ultimate Nature
  Pack's non-snow variants — regular/autumn/dead birches, pines, willows,
  common trees, mossy rocks, cacti, palms, plants — would dress future
  environments (the vision doc's jungle, Mars, etc.) through the same
  `tools/obj2glb_palette.py` pipeline. The pack zip isn't committed (only
  converted .glb files are); re-download it from the itch.io mirror linked
  in assets/CREDITS.md when needed. Two snow trees (BirchTree_Snow_4,
  PineTree_Snow_3) were skipped for being over the triangle budget —
  decimation in Blender could rescue them if variety ever runs thin.
- **Bundle a rounded display font for the UI** (noticed 2026-07-21, real-UI
  session): the HUD currently uses the system font (Segoe UI) with heavy
  weights. A properly chunky rounded font — Fredoka or Baloo 2, both free
  under the SIL Open Font License — would push the cozy tone further.
  Needs a director yes/no because it means downloading a font file into
  the repo (plus a CREDITS.md row). Cheap to do in any later UI session.
- **Turn down the ski-carve sound** (director playtest note, 2026-07-21,
  sound session): the sound effects passed playtest — speed feels real,
  the wind is the favorite — but the ski/carve hiss is too loud relative
  to the rest. A picky-tuning item, not a redo: lower the carve layer's
  loudness (the `carve` numbers in `client/src/audio.ts`'s
  `setLayerTargets`) in the end-of-M2 tuning pass, alongside the parked
  visual tweaks.
- **Dynamic title screen** (director direction, 2026-07-21, sound
  session): the game still drops you straight into the bedroom with no
  framing — no game name, no "press Enter". The director's call: when it
  gets built, it should be a *dynamic* title screen that showcases the
  game world — landscape, enemies, rough terrain, animals, and other
  objects — growing richer as those things are added to the game. Not
  scheduled yet; revisit once there's more world to show off (snowballs,
  tree limbs, critters are all still unbuilt).
