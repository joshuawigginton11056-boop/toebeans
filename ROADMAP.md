# Roadmap

## 2026-07-19 — Project scaffold

Set up the project from scratch: TypeScript (strict) + Three.js + Vite for
the client, npm workspaces for `client`/`server`/`shared`, Vitest for tests.

- `/shared` holds a serializable `GameState` (a list of cats with
  position/velocity) and pure functions (`step`, `setCatVelocity`) that
  return new state instead of mutating.
- `/client` renders that state with Three.js (`render.ts`) — reads state,
  never writes to it. Currently shows one placeholder cat (an orange box)
  drifting across a floor, just to prove the pipeline works.
- `/server` is a minimal stub that imports `/shared` — nothing real yet.
- `npm run check` (typecheck + Vitest) passes; `npm run build` succeeds.
- Fixed a real bug found while testing: the renderer read the container's
  size before layout had settled, producing a 0×0 canvas. Now sizes off
  `window.innerWidth/innerHeight` instead.

**Next:** first actual feature — replace the placeholder box with something
that reflects real gameplay (see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) once that exists,
or [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) for candidates).
